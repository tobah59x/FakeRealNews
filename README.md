# FakeRealNews
 Training a model to detect fake news articles.

These notebooks are part of a capstone project to identify text features that distinguish each of fake news articles, real news and satire from each other. My teammates worked on comparisons of real news to satire and satire to fake news. My part was to work on distinguishing fake news articles from real news.

This README file isn't complete yet. I plan to add an explanation of what the repository contains and provide more context.

For the time being, I'll just clarify that notebook A processes the raw data, transforming it into a format that can be used by the model. Then notebook B does most of the work.
